# BaseRep: On-Chain Reputation Protocol for Base

**A comprehensive reputation and identity infrastructure enabling persistent, verifiable user profiles across the Base ecosystem.**

---

## Overview

BaseRep establishes a universal reputation layer for the Base blockchain, addressing critical gaps in cross-application identity and user verification. The protocol provides developers with tools to build trust-based systems while offering users portable, verifiable credentials across all integrated applications.

### Core Problem

The Base ecosystem currently lacks persistent user identity infrastructure, resulting in:

- **Fragmented User Experience**: Users must rebuild reputation credentials for each new application
- **Sybil Vulnerability**: Limited mechanisms to differentiate authentic users from malicious actors
- **Reduced Network Effects**: No standardized identity layer to enable cross-application collaboration
- **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Difficulty targeting rewards and incentives to genuine contributors

BaseRep provides the foundational infrastructure to resolve these challenges through verifiable, on-chain reputation systems.

    H --> K[Cross-Application Identity]
    I --> L[Verifiable Achievements]
    J --> M[Decentralized Decision Making]
```

### Technical Components

The protocol consists of three primary layers:

1. **Identity & Reputation Layer**: Core scoring and profile management
2. **Economic Layer**: Token distribution and incentive mechanisms
3. **Governance Layer**: Community coordination and decision-making tools

## Reputation Scoring Model

### Score Components

```solidity
struct ReputationScore {
    uint256 engagement;      // Daily activity and consistency metrics
    uint256 achievements;    // Verified accomplishment points
    uint256 contributions;   // Validated work and community value
    uint256 governance;      // Participation in decision-making processes
    uint256 social;          // Community recognition and peer validation
    uint256 consistency;     // Long-term participation and commitment
}
```

### Scoring Algorithm

The BaseRep score is calculated using a weighted composite model:

```
BaseRep Score = 
  (Engagement × 0.25) +
  (Achievements × 0.20) + 
  (Contributions × 0.20) +
  (Governance × 0.15) +
  (Social × 0.10) +
  (Consistency × 0.10)
```

This multi-factor approach ensures balanced reputation growth while minimizing single-vector gaming.

## Integration Guide

### For Application Developers

#### Installation

```bash
npm install @baserep/contracts
```

#### Basic Integration

```solidity
import "@baserep/contracts/BaseRepIntegration.sol";

contract YourDApp {
    BaseRepIntegration public reputationSystem;

    constructor(address _baseRepRegistry) {
        reputationSystem = BaseRepIntegration(_baseRepRegistry);
    }

    function performAction(address user) external {
        // Record user engagement
        reputationSystem.recordEngagement(user, "action_type");
        
        // Implement reputation-gated features
        uint256 userScore = reputationSystem.getReputationScore(user);
        if (userScore >= THRESHOLD) {
            grantPremiumAccess(user);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Advanced Features

```solidity
// Award achievements for milestones
function awardMilestone(address user) internal {
    reputationSystem.mintAchievement(user, "milestone_name", tier);
}

// Check user contribution history
function verifyContributor(address user) public view returns (bool) {
    return reputationSystem.getContributionCount(user) >= MIN_CONTRIBUTIONS;
}
```

### For End Users

#### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Daily engagement check-in
npx baserep check-in

# View reputation profile
npx baserep profile [address]

# Participate in governance
npx baserep vote <proposal-id> <choice>

# Claim bounty rewards
npx baserep bounty claim <bounty-id>
```
