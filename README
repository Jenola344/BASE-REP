BaseRep - On-Chain Reputation Protocol for Base Ecosystem 🏗️🔗

BaseRep is a comprehensive on-chain reputation and engagement protocol that creates persistent digital identity and achievement systems for the Base blockchain ecosystem.

🌟 What Problem Are We Solving?
The Base ecosystem currently lacks persistent user identity and cross-application reputation. This leads to:

🔄 Constant Re-onboarding: Users rebuild reputation in every new dApp

🎭 Sybil Vulnerability: No way to distinguish real users from bots

📉 Shallow Engagement: Limited tools for deep user engagement beyond transactions

🏷️ Fragmented Identity: No unified profile system across Base dApps

BaseRep solves this by creating a universal reputation layer that works across all applications on Base.
