BaseRep - On-Chain Reputation Protocol for Base Ecosystem 🏗️🔗

BaseRep is a comprehensive on-chain reputation and engagement protocol that creates persistent digital identity and achievement systems for the Base blockchain ecosystem.

🌟 What Problem Are We Solving?
The Base ecosystem currently lacks persistent user identity and cross-application reputation. This leads to:

🔄 Constant Re-onboarding: Users rebuild reputation in every new dApp

🎭 Sybil Vulnerability: No way to distinguish real users from bots

📉 Shallow Engagement: Limited tools for deep user engagement beyond transactions

🏷️ Fragmented Identity: No unified profile system across Base dApps

BaseRep solves this by creating a universal reputation layer that works across all applications on Base.

Basic Integration
solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@baserep/AchievementToken.sol";
import "@baserep/EngagementTracker.sol";

contract MyBaseDApp {
    AchievementToken public achievementNFT;
    EngagementTracker public engagement;
    
    constructor(address _achievementToken, address _engagementTracker) {
        achievementNFT = AchievementToken(_achievementToken);
        engagement = EngagementTracker(_engagementTracker);
    }
    
    function completeQuest(address user) external {
        // Track engagement
        engagement.recordActivity(user, "quest_completion");
        
        // Award achievement NFT
        achievementNFT.mintAchievement(user, "quest_champion", 1);
    }
}

🎯 BaseRep Score System
The core of BaseRep is the universal reputation score:

solidity
struct BaseRepScore {
    uint256 engagement;      // From daily activities and consistency
    uint256 achievements;    // NFT-based accomplishment points
    uint256 contributions;   // Verified work and contributions
    uint256 governance;      // Participation in community decisions
    uint256 social;          // Tips received and community recognition
    uint256 consistency;     // Long-term participation metrics
}
Score Calculation
text
BaseRep Score = 
  (Engagement × 0.25) +
  (Achievements × 0.20) + 
  (Contributions × 0.20) +
  (Governance × 0.15) +
  (Social × 0.10) +
  (Consistency × 0.10)
